## Not_Hotdog_Model
In this notebook I will try to recreate a curious model used in an App shown in the HBO serie "Sillicon Valley". 

For this model, I will use the hotdog-nothotdog dataset from Kaggle, and to build the model my way to go was to use Tensorflow using Keras layers to build a Convolutional Neural Network and a pre-trained model to make use of transfer learning from the mobileNet v2 model.

Along the notebook and the code blocks, I will try to explain as best as I can what the building process of this model works and at the end obviously the results I got.

Hopefully I can also build the App as in the serie with this model I built, which is my first model I built by my own.
